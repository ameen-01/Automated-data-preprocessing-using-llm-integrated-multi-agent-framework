🧠 Agentic AI Data Cleaning Pipeline
📝 Project Description
This project implements an Agentic AI–powered data cleaning system that automatically analyzes, plans, and cleans raw datasets using a coordinated set of intelligent agents. Instead of static rule-based preprocessing, this system uses a Controller Agent that dynamically selects appropriate cleaning steps based on dataset characteristics—making the entire process adaptive, explainable, and efficient.
The system is integrated into a Streamlit UI, enabling users to upload messy CSV files and receive a structured, cleaned output along with a detailed log of applied transformations.
